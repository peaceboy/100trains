They have been hauling goods for more than 150 years and have one of the best safety records in the train industry. They also offer some of the best prices on freight out there, making it very easy for them to obtain new contracts and to maintain those they already have in place.<br><h3>The origin of BNSF is a long journey that involves acquiring many small railway companies over the years. One that took place more than 20 years ago was with Santa Fe, thus the changing of the company name.</h3><p> </p>As a result of these buy outs, BNSF has been able to continually expand the number of miles of quality railroad tracks they have available. They have gone the extra mile on their own to place railway tracks where it is difficult but necessary even though it is expensive and there are plenty of challenges to completing such projects.<br><br>BNSF combines the very best equipment and technology with highly skilled employees. All of their train cars and engines are in top working condition to help reduce down time and accidents. They also have skilled employees to investigate railway crossings and the tracks themselves.<br><br>There is always plenty of ongoing training taking place for BNSF employees so they can keep up on the latest technology, evaluate their strengths and weaknesses, and continue to be motivated to strive for excellence in all that they do. BNSF has a very rigorous employment screening process. They check references and criminal backgrounds. They also contact previous employers to determine a person’s level of responsibility and reliability.<br><br>As a condition of employment, each person must consent to a drug test and a physical exam. Should the drug test come back positive the person will not be hired. They also have a random drug testing policy that all employees must agree to during the term of their employment. If an employee files a workman’s compensation claim they are mandated to submit to a drug test as well.<br><br>The physical examination is required to ensure the individual is healthy enough to take on the responsibilities of working for a railway company. This includes a hearing and vision test as well. There is simply too much at risk if a person isn’t healthy enough to be engaging in the various types of employment offered by BNSF.<br><br>If you are interested in finding out what positions they have available and the locations, go to their website. You will find plenty of quality information about the business as well as an application you can complete online. This is one of the best railway companies to work for because they are dedicated to excellence with their employees, their shipments, and the public.<br><br>They take pride in offering a diverse group of employees as well. They appreciate the fact that each person can bring unique qualities to the workplace. They encourage suggestions from their employees to make the railway business safer, faster, and more profitable. Today more than 38,000 people are employed by BNSF. Most of them find the experience to be very pleasant. They enjoy being part of the BNSF team.<br><br>BNSF continues to strive for excellence. They are dedicated to offering quality train services to those businesses that need goods to be moved. They are also dedicated to providing a safe way to do it. They work hard to prevent accidents among their employees, on their train tracks, and with people who happen to be crossing at various train intersections.<br><br>There is always plenty going on at BNSF to help make their trains operate faster to get the deliveries done in less time. They have won numerous awards for their excellent service, implementing the latest technology, and always putting safety above making a profit. They also give plenty of money back to communities in the way of charitable events that support various causes.</div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on September 19, 2018</div><div class="post__share"><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2F100trains.com%2Fburlington-northern-santa-fe.html&amp;via=100trains&amp;text=Burlington%20Northern%20Santa%20Fe" class="js-share twitter" title="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://100trains.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2F100trains.com%2Fburlington-northern-santa-fe.html" class="js-share gplus" title="Share with Google Plus" rel="nofollow"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://100trains.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#gplus"/></svg> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2F100trains.com%2Fburlington-northern-santa-fe.html&amp;media=undefined
